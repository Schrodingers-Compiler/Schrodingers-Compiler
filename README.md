- 👋 Hi, I’m @Schrodingers-Compiler
- 👀 I’m interested in calculus, physics/astrophysics, computers, and music composition
- 🌱 I’m currently learning precalculus (+ calc 1 and 2), coding in C, and much more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, sort of just working as I go along :]
- 📫 How to reach me: on here works fine, but maybe Discord if I set it up
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they (transfem)
- ⚡ Fun fact: the derivative of e^x is itself. Kind of basic knowledge, but I still think it's cool :D
